## Using this boilerplate in a new project

## Storyblok Setup

1. Create a new space in Storyblok

2. Create a new API token in Storyblok
  1. Go to `Settings` -> `Access token` -> `Generate`
  2. Give it a name and select `Preview` access level
  3. Put the token in a `.env` file as `NUXT_STORYBLOK_ACCESS_TOKEN`
3. Login via the CLI
   ```bash
   storyblok login
   ```

## Setup

Make sure you've installed the storyblok CLI:

chmod 400 localhost.key
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha256 -days 365 -key localhost.key -out localhost.crt
```

Reference it in the `package.json` file, in the `scripts` section:

```json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev-ssl": "nuxt dev --https --ssl-cert localhost.crt --ssl-key localhost.key"
  }
  // ...
}
```
